ELDR -- Because you're not getting any younger.
===============================================

Life is too short to be writing what amounts to the same boilerplate code in
every application you develop. The same logging initialization. The same
argument parsing. The same error handling. You get the picture.

ELDR is an application framework that can help with the repetive and sometimes
boring application features so that developers can get to the good stuff sooner.
